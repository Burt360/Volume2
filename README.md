# ACME: Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis

This repo contains work from my undergraduate mathematics program.

Coding lab specs, file templates, data files, and more information about the program can be found at https://acme.byu.edu/.

The first year of the core program consists of *Volume 1: Mathematical Analysis* and *Volume 2: Algorithms, Approximation, Optimization*, each volume consisting of theory and coding coursework.
